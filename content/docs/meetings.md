# Meetings

Staff meetings have evolved a lot over CCM's history and likely will continue to evolve. We currently hold them on Discord.

## Meeting Formats

It is ultimately up to the staff member holding the meeting to determine what style would be best suited to them. A few meeting formats we use are:

- Synchronous chat-based meetings. Ex: Everyone has to log on for a real-time chat conversation.
- Asynchronous chat-based tasks. Ex: People are required to vote in the #polls channel on Discord or co-create a slideshow.
- Synchronous voice/video calls. Ex: Call in the #staff-meetings channel to discuss staff applications.

Regardless of how the meeting is structured, keep in mind that most meetings should include:

1. Status updates on incomplete tasks.
2. Check-ins for relevant staff members to report on their progress.
3. Clear direction/to-do lists for upcoming tasks.

## Rules & Requirements

A few guidelines to keep meetings running smoothly.

1. It is mandatory for EBM to attend weekly meetings. If they cannot come, they must tell the Editorial Director immediately so they can prepare alternate (usually asynchronous) meeting materials for them.
2. CTM are not required to attend staff meetings, but are highly encouraged.
3. If any staff member (including CTM) is expected at a meeting but discovers they cannot attend, they must notify the meeting organizer at least half an hour prior to the meeting.
4. Synchronous voice call meetings tend to last an hour--two hours max. If they do run long are seldom over an hour, EBM are allowed to leave.
5. Please practice basic call courtesy. Be mindful of your mic. Mute yourself if there's a lot of background noise that competes with the speaker.
