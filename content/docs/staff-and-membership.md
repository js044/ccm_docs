This role is divided between two people. Creative Directors are expected to create marketing material and guide the visual identity of CCM.

<u>**Pre Requirements**</u>
- Creative Directors must have access to photo editing software. Adobe Suite is preferred, especially Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign. If they do not have access to Adobe Suite, they must demonstrate that they can work synergistically with their Co-Creative Director using alternative software such as Procreate, Krita, Gimp, etc.

<u>**Responsibilities**</u>
- Create graphics for social media posts and newsletter/blog posts.
- Create transparent thumbnails for issue publication.
- Spearhead the effort to create a cover for each issue based on the theme and tone. This does not necessarily mean they must design the covers by themselves--they are encouraged to collaborate with CTM--but they will be guiding the process and updating CCM regarding its progress.
- Will create design files that can be easily accessed by other team members. In case of emergency, they should be templatized and editable for another member to intervene.
- Assemble print-ready layouts of digital issues. We have a template for print layout, but the Creative Directors must decide the order and layout of pieces and create a PDF deliverable.

## Eligibility

Anyone over the age of 18 can apply to join our staff! Ideal applicants will be communicative, creative, and cooperative. They will also have strong organization skills and be capable of meeting deadlines. Our application requirements vary depending on the position, but they all currently require you to:
- answer a few questions about yourself,
- share any relevant experience,
- and submit three creative samples. 

Check individual applications for more information.

## Recruitment

- Creative Team Members will be actively recruited once per issue cycle.
    - Applications are open year-round, but "off-season" applicants may have to partake in an asynchronous orientation.
    - Synchronous orientation for CTM usually occurs approximately one month before review.
- Editorial Board applications will stay open until they are filled and are reviewed on a rolling basis.
    - If an applicant does not currently qualify for an EB position, they may be offered a role as CTM instead and forgo the CTM application process.
    - Applications are reviewed by the EB and then voted on. At least 75% of the staff must agree on new staff members.
    - All applicants should receive feedback on their application within one month.

## Revocation of Membership

Although we prefer it doesn't come to this, in cases of repeated misconduct, there may be situations in which the Editorial Board will elect to remove a member of CCM.

- If a staff member's behavior is problematic, the Editorial Board will vote on whether or not to issue them a formal warning. Examples of concerning behavior include:
    - Missing more than **four** consecutive meetings with no warning.
    - Consistent non-participation in tasks.
    - Mistreatment of fellow staff or members of the broader community.
- After **three** formal warnings have been issued, the member will be notified of their upcoming removal.
- Depending on the severity of the offense, the member may or may not be banned from the Discord server.
- In the case of a staff member vanishing/"ghosting," staff may choose to forgo formal processes and consider the staff member as having de facto quit. A staff member is classified as "ghosting" if:
    - They are unreachable after two separate attempts to contact them.
    - They have not partaken in anything related to CCM (with no warning) for four consecutive meetings.
    - If a staff member did not intend to quit, they may re-apply later, but there will be a meeting to clarify they are now capable of fulfilling their obligations.
