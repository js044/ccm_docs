  Issue Cycles
  <a class="anchor" href="#issue-cycles">#</a>
</h1>
<p>Each issue cycle, regardless of length, follows a similar process. The timeline should be determined before implementing these steps.</p>
<h1 id="theme-selection">
  Theme Selection
  <a class="anchor" href="#theme-selection">#</a>
</h1>
<p>Each issue has a theme intended to help guide submitters wondering what we&rsquo;re looking for. These themes are voted on in a multi-step process.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Editorial Director (or other EBM) creates a collaborative presentation for interested staff and server members to contribute brief ideas. An example of a presentation like this is <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Y7PGGkVPwsR1SBsrSircvuLiwKJprFXcA8P5TSx55C8/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</li>
<li>The Editorial Director makes a poll based on contributed answers. The poll should be accessible to all server members and allow people to select up to three favorite themes.</li>
<li>The top three results are then presented to the public for voting. There should be an Instagram poll, a Twitter poll, and a Mailchimp poll all soliciting people&rsquo;s feedback.</li>
<li>The Editorial Assistant will write an announcement based on whatever theme wins.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="submissions">
  Submissions
  <a class="anchor" href="#submissions">#</a>
</h1>
<p>After the theme is selected and announced, we open submissions for our current issue. Submitters use Google Forms to submit. Submissions are currently <strong>closed</strong>.</p>

  Submission Categories
  <a class="anchor" href="#submission-categories">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Here at CCM, we’ve branded ourselves as more than a literary magazine. We aim to reach beyond traditional definitions of art and writing. So, we&rsquo;ve reimagined artistic categories as the following:</p>
<div class="book-columns flex flex-wrap">

  <div class="flex-even markdown-inner">
    <ul>
<li><strong>Auditory</strong>
<ul>
<li>Music recordings</li>
<li>Spoken poetry/writing</li>
<li>Film (may also fall under Visual)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Spatial</strong>
<ul>
<li>Topography and GIS</li>
<li>Architectural layouts</li>
<li>Interior design</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Language</strong>
<ul>
<li>Poetry, flash fiction, etc.</li>
<li>Reporting or feature writing</li>
<li>Written sheet music</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

  </div>

  <div class="flex-even markdown-inner">
    <ul>
<li><strong>Visual</strong>
<ul>
<li>Video games, visual novels</li>
<li>Coding and programming</li>
<li>Computer generated imagery *</li>
<li>Culinary art</li>
<li>Character design</li>
<li>Textiles, clothing, and fashion design</li>
<li>Cosmetology</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cultural/Social</strong>
<ul>
<li>Essays and research</li>
<li>Field notes and creative data</li>
<li>Polls</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

  </div>

</div>

<p>You can combine elements of these categories &ndash; several of the examples we provided can fall into multiple categories, and we encourage you not to let these categories limit you. If you are able to create work that exists completely outside of these categories, we will gladly review your submitted work with care and openness.</p>
<blockquote class="book-hint info">
  * <strong>Note:</strong> When we came up with this category, we were referring to content such as HTML canvas drawings, CGI, etc. Since then, AI art has become a more popular technology, which we feel requires special guideline clarification. Please see the <u>Submission Guidelines</u> for more information.
</blockquote>

<h2 id="submission-guidelines">
  Submission Guidelines
  <a class="anchor" href="#submission-guidelines">#</a>
</h2>
<ul>
<li>The maximum number of pieces anyone can submit to CCM (or have published) per issue is <strong>three</strong>.</li>
<li>Staff members may submit to CCM.</li>
<li>We allow simultaneous submissions.</li>
<li>It will never cost money to submit to CCM.</li>
<li>We value documentation. Even if we like a piece, if the documentation is poor (low resolution, shaky, dimly lit), its odds of being published are lower.</li>
<li>Our Google Forms are set up to take a maximum combined file size attachment of 1GB. If, for any reason, your files exceed this limit, please email us so we can figure out an alternative.</li>
<li>If you are submitting visual art, please be sure to submit high-quality images. 150 to 300 ppi is ideal.</li>
<li>15,000 word limit on writing.</li>
<li>Work may be previously published, but you must clarify this on your submission and include a source as to where the work has been previously published. Please also ensure the other publication permits you to re-publish the piece.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="book-hint info">
  <strong>Note on AI-generated work:</strong> AI-generated art is still a nascent technology and, as such, our standards are subject to change. We currently allow AI-generated work as long as the AI has been exclusively trained with <u>your</u> work. Please be purposeful, ethical, and creative with any implementations of this technology for submission purposes, and clarify in your submission it is AI-generated.
</blockquote>

<h1 id="review">
  Review
  <a class="anchor" href="#review">#</a>
</h1>
<p>For now, the Managing Editors run one review team each. If they are unavailable, another Editorial Board Member will substitute. One team handles Visual/Spatial/Auditory submissions and the other handles Language/Cultural &amp; Social. In the future, depending on volume of submissions and staff availability, these teams may be restructured.</p>
<h2 id="phase-1-before-review">
  Phase 1: Before Review
  <a class="anchor" href="#phase-1-before-review">#</a>
</h2>
<ol>
<li>The Editorial Assistant should aggregate the submissions into a packet/slideshow to be ready for review anonymously.
<ul>
<li>All files should be titled in a name_title format when submitted (doe_cicadadrawing.jpg) If the file names will be visible during the presentation process, please create copies of the files without last names.</li>
<li>Packets/presentations should include the title of the work. This often changes the interpretation of the work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Packets/slideshows will be distributed via email prior to the review session. Discord notifications will also be sent when the packets are sent. This ideally is done at least one week before review.</li>
<li>All Cicada members will review the packet and should have some notes in mind prior to the review day.</li>
<li>At some point before review, the Editorial Assistant or Managing Editors should create a post on Discord in the #review channel. They should create a numbered list of pieces they are going to review.
<ul>
<li>The EBM will create a thread keeping track of the votes and scores.</li>
<li>This is also where people can vote asynchronously.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="phase-2-during-review">
  Phase 2: During Review
  <a class="anchor" href="#phase-2-during-review">#</a>
</h2>
<ol>
<li>Based on the number of submissions, the review leaders will create a time limit to review each work and will monitor that time during review. (Going somewhat over the limit OK as some pieces will naturally take more time to process than others.)</li>
<li>Review leaders will steer the conversation by:
<ul>
<li>Introducing the piece with its title</li>
<li>Sharing any necessary information that may add to the interpretation (interesting mediums? Large or small dimensions?)</li>
<li>Stopping the conversation from looping. If the EBM feels as though the conversation is just repeating itself they will step in and move things along.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When reviewers have made up their minds about a piece, they may score it in one of two ways:
<ol>
<li>Verbally. The review leader will ask for people&rsquo;s votes and keep track of them in the thread and on the spreadsheet.</li>
<li>Reviewers can also reply in thread to a post with their score.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Review leaders will record each piece’s score. Pieces are reviewed on a score of 1-3. Note that in-between votes (like 2.5) are allowed.
<ul>
<li><strong>Score Guide:</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>= Amazing!</li>
<li>= Good/Acceptable</li>
<li>= Insufficient</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="phase-3-after-review">
  Phase 3: After Review
  <a class="anchor" href="#phase-3-after-review">#</a>
</h2>
<ol>
<li>Scores should be divided by the total reviewers to get an average score and recorded in the Google Sheets file.</li>
<li>EB leaders will work together to determine a cutoff line. This line is adjustable based on the amount submitted. As more editions are published the cutoff line should become more and more consistent. It is only currently flexible to adjust to varying submissions.</li>
<li>EB leaders will then sort the files of each piece according to what was accepted and what was rejected. EB leaders will move the ORIGINAL FILES - not the anonymous ones. Accepted files will not be moved. Not accepted files will be moved into a folder titled “not accepted.”</li>
<li>The Communications Director will send out rejection/acceptance emails to submitters and ask for any necessary additional information.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="cover-design">
  Cover Design
  <a class="anchor" href="#cover-design">#</a>
</h1>
<p>The cover is crafted by the Creative Directors. This often happens collaboratively with Creative Team Members.</p>
<ol>
<li>Any interested staff will sign up to join a cover design meeting.</li>
<li>Staff members will create a &ldquo;post&rdquo; in the <code>#cover-design</code> forum channel on Discord and tag it with whatever issue they are suggesting for. In their post, they can deliver as many pitches for the cover concepts as they like. This may include using other inspiration images, writing out concepts, etc.
<ul>
<li>An example might be someone proposing the design motif of &ldquo;hazy&rdquo; and using accompanying photos of hazy typography as a model.</li>
<li>Because presentations will ultimately be going around based on presenter as opposed to idea, people should put all their ideas in one thread and then present them in succession.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After the deadline for submitting proposals, we will hold a formal cover design meeting and discuss each person&rsquo;s idea.</li>
<li>An EBM will create a poll synthesizing the cover design ideas from the meeting.</li>
<li>Creative Directors will use the results of the poll as guidance in crafting a cover.
<ul>
<li>This usually means combining the top 2-3 design elements proposed.</li>
<li>If the Creative Directors use design elements proposed by a staff member who has expressed interest in being involved with the cover&rsquo;s design, the Creative Directors may reach out to that person(s) and ask for their assistance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="publish">
  Publish
  <a class="anchor" href="#publish">#</a>
</h1>
<p>The tasks we need to take in the final stretch of an Issue cycle include, but are not limited to the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>Creative Directors (or any available staff member) must turn select accepted pieces into transparent PNG thumbnails.</li>
<li>Creative Directors must also decide the order of the magazine and how it will look best arranged. If no one performs this task, it is ultimately to the discretion of the Web Developer.</li>
<li>The Web Developer is responsible for actually making the issue live.
<ul>
<li>See our <a href="../../docs/tutorials/hugo">Hugo tutorials</a> for more information.</li>
<li>It is up to the Web Developer to maintain best practices for file management. If everyone else has followed proper naming protocol, this should be relatively straightforward.</li>
<li>The Communications Director and any other interested staff members should assist by writing alt text for published pieces.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Managing Editors will announce the publication of the issue in the monthly newsletter.</li>
</ol>
