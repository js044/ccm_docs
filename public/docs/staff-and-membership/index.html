</h2>
<p>Although we prefer it doesn&rsquo;t come to this, in cases of repeated misconduct, there may be situations in which the Editorial Board will elect to remove a member of CCM.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a staff member&rsquo;s behavior is problematic, the Editorial Board will vote on whether or not to issue them a formal warning. Examples of concerning behavior include:
<ul>
<li>Missing more than <strong>four</strong> consecutive meetings with no warning.</li>
<li>Consistent non-participation in tasks.</li>
<li>Mistreatment of fellow staff or members of the broader community.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After <strong>three</strong> formal warnings have been issued, the member will be notified of their upcoming removal.</li>
<li>Depending on the severity of the offense, the member may or may not be banned from the Discord server.</li>
<li>In the case of a staff member vanishing/&ldquo;ghosting,&rdquo; staff may choose to forgo formal processes and consider the staff member as having de facto quit. A staff member is classified as &ldquo;ghosting&rdquo; if:
<ul>
<li>They are unreachable after two separate attempts to contact them.</li>
<li>They have not partaken in anything related to CCM (with no warning) for four consecutive meetings.</li>
<li>If a staff member did not intend to quit, they may re-apply later, but there will be a meeting to clarify they are now capable of fulfilling their obligations.</li>
