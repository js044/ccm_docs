[{"id":0,"href":"/docs/about/","title":"About Cicada","section":"Docs","content":"\rAbout Cicada\r#\rCicada Creative Magazine is an interdisciplinary, all-arts publication. Submissions typically open twice a year, once in the spring and fall. At the end of each issue cycle, these submissions are anonymized and reviewed by two editorial teams. Then, we publish a carefully crafted issue of your work.\nWe acknowledge that art doesn’t always come box-shaped, perfectly ready to fall into a category. Cicada Creative Magazine exists to showcase that artistic exploration and novelty.\nOur Origins\r#\rCicada was founded in 2018, the brainchild of seven undergraduate students at Colorado State University. We wanted to assemble something new: a creative magazine accessible to all CSU undergraduate students across all disciplines. At the time, our on-campus publications were open only to a sliver of students based on GPA or major, and most literary magazines focus exclusively on writing and/or visual art. We believe these limitations stifle creativity and expression. There is artistry in science, in math, in lines of code \u0026ndash; and we wanted to include it all. We made this spread on our third meeting to guide our vision.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve evolved a lot since our first meetings at a coffee shop on the corner of campus, but our core mission has never wavered. Instead, it has expanded. When the COVID-19 pandemic moved the world online in 2020, we adapted and went fully remote, opening our submissions to undergraduates everywhere.\nGoals \u0026amp; Vision\r#\rOne of the ways we stay tethered to our mission is by putting our ideals down to paper and committing to specific goals that we want to move toward together.\nCreate an accessible space for creative people anywhere to build community and share art. Eliminate traditional barriers for artists, such as educational and financial requirements. Build a sustainable project that can long outlive its original creators. Craft a unique visual and personal brand for our community. Collaborate with other creative publications and help to build a coalition of welcoming, inclusive mags/zines/etc. "},{"id":1,"href":"/docs/staff-and-membership/","title":"Staff \u0026 Membership","section":"Docs","content":"\rStaff \u0026amp; Membership\r#\rCCM\u0026rsquo;s staff is divided into two branches: the Editorial Board (EB) and the Creative Team (CT).\nEditorial Board\r#\rThe Editorial Board takes the lead on publishing each issue and oversees all administrative and design tasks. It is comprised of six roles. Click through each to learn more about the position. Open positions contain a link to the application. Applicants may fill out multiple applications; we will place you in the position you seem strongest in.\n= Position open\n= Position closed\nEditorial Director\rEditorial Director #\rThe Editorial Director is the head of the Editorial Board. They are responsible for the logistics and direction of the organization. This includes running meetings, maintaining documentation, and setting agendas.\nResponsibilities\nPrepare and announce the agenda for weekly staff meetings. This requires delegating tasks, tracking their progress, and ensuring we stay on schedule. The Editorial Director is also responsible for announcing organizational changes such as membership changes, deadline extensions, meeting cancellations, etc. Create applications for submissions and staff. Prepare tutorials, minutes, and other documentation for posterity and onboarding. These documents are expected to be organized and easily accessible to other members. Communicate with staff to streamline work processes. Interface with CTM and EB in the case of disciplinary action and/or potential dismissal. Assign appropriate accommodations for staff, assist with conflict resolution, and act as a resource for the server and staff. Keep track of financial obligations (such as website domain renewal) and ensure we are up to date on payment. Applications closed\nEditorial Assistant\rEditorial Assistant #\rThe Editorial Assistant is responsible for establishing a timeline, onboarding CTM, and facilitating the review process. They can substitute for the Editorial Director in case of their absence.\nResponsibilities\nSketch out the timeline for each CCM publication. Facilitate the biyearly review process by tracking submissions with a spreadsheet, coordinating blind review, and tallying votes. Lead the biyearly CTM recruitment and onboarding. This includes contacting the applicants, selecting pieces for mock review, and managing the orientation. Take meeting minutes and upload them to Google Drive and Discord. Coordinate workshops alongside Managing Editors. Apply here!\nManaging Editor\rManaging Editor #\rThis role is divided between two people. Managing Editors lead workshops and review sessions and architect the newsletter. One Managing Editor should be more language-oriented and the other more familiar with visual arts.\nResponsibilities\nOversee the monthly newsletter process. This requires selecting the newsletter theme, soliciting content from members, writing copy, etc. Update the Google Calendar with monthly deadlines for newsletter curation. Conduct the biyearly review process. One Managing Editor will head the Language/Cultural \u0026amp; Social (LCS) review team and the other will lead the Visual/Spatial/Auditory (VSA) team. Managing Editors will oversee workshops according to their skillset. (LCS Managing Editor runs writing workshops; VSA Managing Editor runs visual arts workshops.) Apply here!\nCreative Director\rCreative Director #\rThis role is divided between two people. Creative Directors are expected to create marketing material and guide the visual identity of CCM.\nPre Requirements\nCreative Directors must have access to photo editing software. Adobe Suite is preferred, especially Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign. If they do not have access to Adobe Suite, they must demonstrate that they can work synergistically with their Co-Creative Director using alternative software such as Procreate, Krita, Gimp, etc. Responsibilities\nCreate graphics for social media posts and newsletter/blog posts. Create transparent thumbnails for issue publication. Spearhead the effort to create a cover for each issue based on the theme and tone. This does not necessarily mean they must design the covers by themselves\u0026ndash;they are encouraged to collaborate with CTM\u0026ndash;but they will be guiding the process and updating CCM regarding its progress. Will create design files that can be easily accessed by other team members. In case of emergency, they should be templatized and editable for another member to intervene. Assemble print-ready layouts of digital issues. We have a template for print layout, but the Creative Directors must decide the order and layout of pieces and create a PDF deliverable. Applications closed\nCommunications Director\rCommunications Director #\rThis role is dedicated to managing how we interface with the public.\nResponsibilities\nRun Creation Week and solicit ideas from EBM, CTM, and the general public to initiate social media campaigns, posts, etc. Oversee our email account and reply within three business days. Send acceptance/rejection emails for submitters and applicants. Manage Twitter and Instagram accounts\u0026ndash;this includes networking, replying to direct messages, etc. Develop a repeatable, predictable schedule for social media activity and campaigns. Investigate litmag contests, conferences, and other opportunities. Apply here!\nWeb Developer\rWeb Developer #\rThe Web Developer is expected to manage our website’s code and oversee the Discord server.\nPre Requirements\nMust be well-versed in HTML, CSS, and Javascript for front-end web management. Must know how to host static websites (or be willing to learn). Be aware of best practices for accessibility on the web; must be able to implement Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Responsibilities\nWork in collaboration with the Creative Directors to update the website’s front-end code. Our current workflow utilizes Hugo, Netlify, and Github. Update the website according to new information (such as staff changes). Upload the issue. The Web Developer must communicate their progress to develop an accurate timeline. Secure the login/password information to all social media accounts and periodically update the credentials based on membership changes. Oversee our Discord server and maintain the bots, server health, etc. Apply here!\nCreative Team\r#\rCTM are recruited twice a year, but off-season applications are also accepted. They operate on more of an as-needed basis and are not expected to devote the same level of commitment as Editorial Board members.\nCreative Team Member\rCreative Team Member #\rCreative Team Members assist with review sessions and blog content.\nResponsibilities\nAttend review sessions, contribute substantively to the conversation, and vote on submissions. There are usually 2-3 review sessions per issue cycle, each one lasting approximately 2 hours or less. Each CTM is expected to contribute to the blog and/or social media content at least once per issue cycle. Assist with community-building efforts by helping organize events and social media campaigns. Apply here!\nEligibility\r#\rAnyone over the age of 18 can apply to join our staff! Ideal applicants will be communicative, creative, and cooperative. They will also have strong organization skills and be capable of meeting deadlines. Our application requirements vary depending on the position, but they all currently require you to:\nanswer a few questions about yourself, share any relevant experience, and submit three creative samples. Check individual applications for more information.\nRecruitment\r#\rCreative Team Members will be actively recruited once per issue cycle. Applications are open year-round, but \u0026ldquo;off-season\u0026rdquo; applicants may have to partake in an asynchronous orientation. Synchronous orientation for CTM usually occurs approximately one month before review. Editorial Board applications will stay open until they are filled and are reviewed on a rolling basis. If an applicant does not currently qualify for an EB position, they may be offered a role as CTM instead and forgo the CTM application process. Applications are reviewed by the EB and then voted on. At least 75% of the staff must agree on new staff members. All applicants should receive feedback on their application within one month. Revocation of Membership\r#\rAlthough we prefer it doesn\u0026rsquo;t come to this, in cases of repeated misconduct, there may be situations in which the Editorial Board will elect to remove a member of CCM.\nIf a staff member\u0026rsquo;s behavior is problematic, the Editorial Board will vote on whether or not to issue them a formal warning. Examples of concerning behavior include: Missing more than four consecutive meetings with no warning. Consistent non-participation in tasks. Mistreatment of fellow staff or members of the broader community. After three formal warnings have been issued, the member will be notified of their upcoming removal. Depending on the severity of the offense, the member may or may not be banned from the Discord server. In the case of a staff member vanishing/\u0026ldquo;ghosting,\u0026rdquo; staff may choose to forgo formal processes and consider the staff member as having de facto quit. A staff member is classified as \u0026ldquo;ghosting\u0026rdquo; if: They are unreachable after two separate attempts to contact them. They have not partaken in anything related to CCM (with no warning) for four consecutive meetings. If a staff member did not intend to quit, they may re-apply later, but there will be a meeting to clarify they are now capable of fulfilling their obligations. "},{"id":2,"href":"/docs/meetings/","title":"Meetings","section":"Docs","content":"\rMeetings\r#\rStaff meetings have evolved a lot over CCM\u0026rsquo;s history and likely will continue to evolve. We currently hold them on Discord.\nMeeting Formats\r#\rIt is ultimately up to the staff member holding the meeting to determine what style would be best suited to them. A few meeting formats we use are:\nSynchronous chat-based meetings. Ex: Everyone has to log on for a real-time chat conversation. Asynchronous chat-based tasks. Ex: People are required to vote in the #polls channel on Discord or co-create a slideshow. Synchronous voice/video calls. Ex: Call in the #staff-meetings channel to discuss staff applications. Regardless of how the meeting is structured, keep in mind that most meetings should include:\nStatus updates on incomplete tasks. Check-ins for relevant staff members to report on their progress. Clear direction/to-do lists for upcoming tasks. Rules \u0026amp; Requirements\r#\rA few guidelines to keep meetings running smoothly.\nIt is mandatory for EBM to attend weekly meetings. If they cannot come, they must tell the Editorial Director immediately so they can prepare alternate (usually asynchronous) meeting materials for them. CTM are not required to attend staff meetings, but are highly encouraged. If any staff member (including CTM) is expected at a meeting but discovers they cannot attend, they must notify the meeting organizer at least half an hour prior to the meeting. Synchronous voice call meetings tend to last an hour\u0026ndash;two hours max. If they do run long are seldom over an hour, EBM are allowed to leave. Please practice basic call courtesy. Be mindful of your mic. Mute yourself if there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of background noise that competes with the speaker. "},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/issue-cycles/","title":"Issue Cycles","section":"Docs","content":"\rIssue Cycles\r#\rEach issue cycle, regardless of length, follows a similar process. The timeline should be determined before implementing these steps.\nTheme Selection\r#\rEach issue has a theme intended to help guide submitters wondering what we\u0026rsquo;re looking for. These themes are voted on in a multi-step process.\nThe Editorial Director (or other EBM) creates a collaborative presentation for interested staff and server members to contribute brief ideas. An example of a presentation like this is here. The Editorial Director makes a poll based on contributed answers. The poll should be accessible to all server members and allow people to select up to three favorite themes. The top three results are then presented to the public for voting. There should be an Instagram poll, a Twitter poll, and a Mailchimp poll all soliciting people\u0026rsquo;s feedback. The Editorial Assistant will write an announcement based on whatever theme wins. Submissions\r#\rAfter the theme is selected and announced, we open submissions for our current issue. Submitters use Google Forms to submit. Submissions are currently closed.\nSubmission Categories\r#\rHere at CCM, we’ve branded ourselves as more than a literary magazine. We aim to reach beyond traditional definitions of art and writing. So, we\u0026rsquo;ve reimagined artistic categories as the following:\nAuditory Music recordings Spoken poetry/writing Film (may also fall under Visual) Spatial Topography and GIS Architectural layouts Interior design Language Poetry, flash fiction, etc. Reporting or feature writing Written sheet music Visual Video games, visual novels Coding and programming Computer generated imagery * Culinary art Character design Textiles, clothing, and fashion design Cosmetology Cultural/Social Essays and research Field notes and creative data Polls You can combine elements of these categories \u0026ndash; several of the examples we provided can fall into multiple categories, and we encourage you not to let these categories limit you. If you are able to create work that exists completely outside of these categories, we will gladly review your submitted work with care and openness.\n* Note: When we came up with this category, we were referring to content such as HTML canvas drawings, CGI, etc. Since then, AI art has become a more popular technology, which we feel requires special guideline clarification. Please see the Submission Guidelines for more information.\rSubmission Guidelines\r#\rThe maximum number of pieces anyone can submit to CCM (or have published) per issue is three. Staff members may submit to CCM. We allow simultaneous submissions. It will never cost money to submit to CCM. We value documentation. Even if we like a piece, if the documentation is poor (low resolution, shaky, dimly lit), its odds of being published are lower. Our Google Forms are set up to take a maximum combined file size attachment of 1GB. If, for any reason, your files exceed this limit, please email us so we can figure out an alternative. If you are submitting visual art, please be sure to submit high-quality images. 150 to 300 ppi is ideal. 15,000 word limit on writing. Work may be previously published, but you must clarify this on your submission and include a source as to where the work has been previously published. Please also ensure the other publication permits you to re-publish the piece. Note on AI-generated work: AI-generated art is still a nascent technology and, as such, our standards are subject to change. We currently allow AI-generated work as long as the AI has been exclusively trained with your work. Please be purposeful, ethical, and creative with any implementations of this technology for submission purposes, and clarify in your submission it is AI-generated.\rReview\r#\rFor now, the Managing Editors run one review team each. If they are unavailable, another Editorial Board Member will substitute. One team handles Visual/Spatial/Auditory submissions and the other handles Language/Cultural \u0026amp; Social. In the future, depending on volume of submissions and staff availability, these teams may be restructured.\nPhase 1: Before Review\r#\rThe Editorial Assistant should aggregate the submissions into a packet/slideshow to be ready for review anonymously. All files should be titled in a name_title format when submitted (doe_cicadadrawing.jpg) If the file names will be visible during the presentation process, please create copies of the files without last names. Packets/presentations should include the title of the work. This often changes the interpretation of the work. Packets/slideshows will be distributed via email prior to the review session. Discord notifications will also be sent when the packets are sent. This ideally is done at least one week before review. All Cicada members will review the packet and should have some notes in mind prior to the review day. At some point before review, the Editorial Assistant or Managing Editors should create a post on Discord in the #review channel. They should create a numbered list of pieces they are going to review. The EBM will create a thread keeping track of the votes and scores. This is also where people can vote asynchronously. Phase 2: During Review\r#\rBased on the number of submissions, the review leaders will create a time limit to review each work and will monitor that time during review. (Going somewhat over the limit OK as some pieces will naturally take more time to process than others.) Review leaders will steer the conversation by: Introducing the piece with its title Sharing any necessary information that may add to the interpretation (interesting mediums? Large or small dimensions?) Stopping the conversation from looping. If the EBM feels as though the conversation is just repeating itself they will step in and move things along. When reviewers have made up their minds about a piece, they may score it in one of two ways: Verbally. The review leader will ask for people\u0026rsquo;s votes and keep track of them in the thread and on the spreadsheet. Reviewers can also reply in thread to a post with their score. Review leaders will record each piece’s score. Pieces are reviewed on a score of 1-3. Note that in-between votes (like 2.5) are allowed. Score Guide: = Amazing! = Good/Acceptable = Insufficient Phase 3: After Review\r#\rScores should be divided by the total reviewers to get an average score and recorded in the Google Sheets file. EB leaders will work together to determine a cutoff line. This line is adjustable based on the amount submitted. As more editions are published the cutoff line should become more and more consistent. It is only currently flexible to adjust to varying submissions. EB leaders will then sort the files of each piece according to what was accepted and what was rejected. EB leaders will move the ORIGINAL FILES - not the anonymous ones. Accepted files will not be moved. Not accepted files will be moved into a folder titled “not accepted.” The Communications Director will send out rejection/acceptance emails to submitters and ask for any necessary additional information. Cover Design\r#\rThe cover is crafted by the Creative Directors. This often happens collaboratively with Creative Team Members.\nAny interested staff will sign up to join a cover design meeting. Staff members will create a \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; in the #cover-design forum channel on Discord and tag it with whatever issue they are suggesting for. In their post, they can deliver as many pitches for the cover concepts as they like. This may include using other inspiration images, writing out concepts, etc. An example might be someone proposing the design motif of \u0026ldquo;hazy\u0026rdquo; and using accompanying photos of hazy typography as a model. Because presentations will ultimately be going around based on presenter as opposed to idea, people should put all their ideas in one thread and then present them in succession. After the deadline for submitting proposals, we will hold a formal cover design meeting and discuss each person\u0026rsquo;s idea. An EBM will create a poll synthesizing the cover design ideas from the meeting. Creative Directors will use the results of the poll as guidance in crafting a cover. This usually means combining the top 2-3 design elements proposed. If the Creative Directors use design elements proposed by a staff member who has expressed interest in being involved with the cover\u0026rsquo;s design, the Creative Directors may reach out to that person(s) and ask for their assistance. Publish\r#\rThe tasks we need to take in the final stretch of an Issue cycle include, but are not limited to the following.\nCreative Directors (or any available staff member) must turn select accepted pieces into transparent PNG thumbnails. Creative Directors must also decide the order of the magazine and how it will look best arranged. If no one performs this task, it is ultimately to the discretion of the Web Developer. The Web Developer is responsible for actually making the issue live. See our Hugo tutorials for more information. It is up to the Web Developer to maintain best practices for file management. If everyone else has followed proper naming protocol, this should be relatively straightforward. The Communications Director and any other interested staff members should assist by writing alt text for published pieces. The Managing Editors will announce the publication of the issue in the monthly newsletter. Published Issues\r#\rIssues we\u0026rsquo;ve published so far.

The estimated date of release. The Managing Editor will create a thread from the post prompting CTM \u0026amp; EB to sign up. The Managing Editors will oversee staff based on the following general schedule: Week 1: Announce theme, get signups. Week 2: Check in with staff members who have committed to making content. Week 3: Review/edit rough drafts and receive final drafts. Week 4: Publish newsletter. Content\r#\rExamples of content that staff can suggest and/or sign up to create: Blog posts written by staff members. CTM are especially encouraged to contribute to the blog. Blog posts can be anything from doodles to essays to songs to graphics. Crossposting content made for social media/creation week: such as the collaborative Spotify playlist. Interactive elements like polls and surveys. Each newsletter should have 3-4 pieces of content. A Managing Editor (or other staff member) writes copy for the newsletter body. Creative Directors are recruited to make illustrations to accompany the blog posts. The newsletter may also reuse graphics the Creative Directors have created for social media. Blog\r#\rOur blog is a collection of writing and art our staff has created for the newsletter. It also contains important organizational updates. A few notes:\nBlog posts are ultimately uploaded in Markdown. They can be submitted to Managing Editors either via Google Docs, a text document, or a Markdown file. Please refer to this section of the docs for instructions on making a blog post public. Managing Editors will oversee the timeline to ensure blog posts are uploaded at least one day before the newsletter is released. Creation Week\r#\rEarly each month, the Communications Director should make a post in the #creation-week channel on Discord planning out the social media calendar (and possibly soliciting social media post suggestions.) Ideally, we will have ~2 pieces of social media engagement per week. This is meant to work synergistically with the newsletter/blog.\nExamples of content that may be suggested:\nSocial media campaigns \u0026ldquo;This-or-that\u0026rdquo; polls Instagram takeover Highlights Previously published pieces Specific blog posts Announcements Staff vacancies Submissions/workshops opening Marketing Posts about the server Merch/physical copies Newsletter posts If the Communications Director struggles to generate all 7-8 social media pieces for the month, they may solicit suggestions from other staff members.\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/docs/workshops/","title":"Workshops","section":"Docs","content":"\rWorkshops\r#\rWorkshops are a newer implementation, and so these guidelines are still more of a loose starting point. They are intended to be versatile enough to describe multiple types of workshops.\nWorkshops are generally run by Managing Editors, but if any staff member is qualified and interested, they may also host a workshop. Workshops are not a recurrent, scheduled event (yet). Instead, when a staff member has bandwidth, they announce and plan a workshop a few weeks (or months) in advance. The Communications Director should help this staff member market the workshop. This is something that could be pitched during Creation Week. The Managing Editors may include news of this workshop in the newsletter as well. The Creative Directors would also assist in creating graphics to let people know about workshop. The procedure is relatively similar to Review. A staff member creates an \u0026ldquo;Event\u0026rdquo; on Discord for people to RSVP to. Submissions are opened for workshop. Anyone who submits is agreeing to attend workshop. The workshop leader sends a packet of these submissions out to all submitters with instructions on how to workshop. The staff member runs review in a designated channel\u0026rsquo;s voice call and conducts review. Workshop is intended to be 2 hours or less, so the workshop leader may have to cap submissions, split sessions, etc. "},{"id":6,"href":"/docs/faq/","title":"FAQ","section":"Docs","content":"\rFrequently Asked Questions\r#\r1.

Our issue pages work by rendering different types of content in different ways\u0026ndash;we use a mix of thumbnails and text titles. For this to work, we have to add front matter to each piece clarifying its type, which you can do using the following command template: hugo new -k [writing/art] issues/issue-[#]/[writing/art]/[title.md]\nThe -k denotes type of thumbnail.\nExample: hugo new -k writing issues/issue-2/writing/writing-piece-1.md would create a webpage that goes to /issue-2/writing-piece-1\nNote: Our config file allows us to skip the writing/art slug when the page is loaded.
